# Gamer Countdown Timer

Edited from my [pomodoro-timer](https://github.com/BinaryDigitlol/pomodoro-timer) repo for KilobyteKeith's game stream!

<hr>

I've forked Bear's awesome [pomodoro-timer](https://github.com/SpectacledBear/pomodoro-timer) project and added styling with [PaperCSS](https://www.getpapercss.com/) and a new alarm sound from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=music&utm_content=6402). Tomato favicon via [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji).


<hr>

I created this simple HTML page to assist me in using the Pomodoro technique. It provides a countdown timer based on the three activities outlined in this technique.
